Valentino is one our customers. In this project, you are asked to create a web service containing an ML model that given an image as the input, will return a list of most similar images.



Here are the specifications:

The web service has a POST endpoint that receives an image from the list below and returns up to 10 products that are most similar to the input image
The web service is written in Python
You're free to choose any Python framework to build the service
The web service is running inside a Docker image
The Docker image is as small and as efficient as possible
All images, including the input, are chosen from the image list below


You can download the list of images from this link: https://xgen-interview-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/valentino_links.csv

In order to download the images on your local system, you need to write a script.
